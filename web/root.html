		<h1>Welcome to ZiLCh</h1>
		<h3>Zipcode Lookup Channel</h3>
		<p>
			ZiLCh is a simple REST-like API used to lookup information about zip codes. 
			It's very simple to use, as it has only one URL to retrieve from (/query). Here's an
			<a href="/example.html">example page</a> to play around with.
		</p>
		<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
		<p>Zilch! It's in the name.</p>
		<h4>Do I need an application key?</h4>
		<p>Nope, but if you really want one, yours is 1234. Shh!! Don't tell anyone.</p>
		<h4>What query parameters are supported?</h4>
		<h4>Why build this service in the first place?</h4>
		<p>
			After implementing zip-code lookup features in three different applications in the same year, I decided that there really ought to be an open-source,
			and free to use version of this feature.  It should support XML and JSONP, and should be simple to plug into any web or mobile app.  The US Postal Service
			does provide a SOAP based free lookup, but I tried to access it, and it required an application key, which you have to get by emailing somebody at USPS.
			I've tried this, and never received a response.  There are other services available online, but they all want you to pay after exceeding a request limit.
			This service is free.  <em>There are no limits.</em>  If I start to get hammered by requests, I may start asking for donations, but I am nowhere near that
			point.  Until then, enjoy.
		</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr> <td>ZipCode</td> <td>The zip code you're looking for.</td> </tr>
				<tr> <td>City</td> <td>Any part of the city's name (eg: Phila will find Philadelphia). Not case sensitive.</td> </tr>
				<tr> <td>Country</td> <td>The 2-letter country code. Uppercase only.</td> </tr>
				<tr> <td>State</td> <td>The state abbreviation. Uppercase only.</td> </tr>
				<tr> <td>County</td> <td>Any part of the county's name. Not all countries have county data. Not case sensitive.</td> </tr>
				<tr> <td>AreaCode</td> <td>The 3-digit area code for a phone number. United States Only.</td> </tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			I can't guarantee that a zip/postal code will be universally unique, only that it is unique to a country.  For instance, the zip code "20010"
			is used in more than one country: <a href="/query.yaml?ZipCode=20010">/query?ZipCode=20010</a>. Including a country code in the query will ensure a 
			unique response when querying by zip code: <a href="/query.yaml?ZipCode=20010&Country=US">/query.yaml?ZipCode=20010&amp<b>Country=US</b></a>.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a hard limit of 1,000 records returned in any query.</p>
		<h4>What response formats are supported?</h4>
		<p>The response format is selected by changing the file extension of "/query" (eg: /query.xml)
			<ul>
				<li>JSON: /query.json or /query.js (this is the default format if no extension is added)</li>
				<li>XML: /query.xml</li>
				<li>YAML: /query.yaml</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4>What about JSONP support?</h4>
		<p>
			If you hit this service directly from a browser, you'll probably want to use JSONP in order to
			avoid cross-domain scripting issues.  Simply add your callback to your GET request via the "callback"
			or "jsonp" query parameters.  This is supported out-of-the-box by Javascript APIs like 
			<a href="http://jquery.org">jQuery</a>.  The only response format for JSONP is JSON.
			Here's an example: <a href="/query.js?callback=mycallback&ZipCode=12345">/query.js?<b>callback=mycallback</b>&amp;ZipCode=12345</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			For browsers that don't fully support open standards (I won't name any names, but Internet Explorer knows who I'm talking about), make sure
			to add the ".js" file extension to the url, as seen in the example above.
		</p>
		<h4>What countries are supported?</h4>
		<div ng-controller="RootController">
		<p>There are currently {{total}} records in the zip code database supporting the following countries:
			<ul id="countries">
				<li ng-repeat="country in countries">{{country}}</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>Data comes from the US Postal Service and GeoNames.org.</p>
		<p>Check out the distribution map below to see the coverage.<br/>

		<p>Here is a <a href="/map.html">3D Version of the Distribution Map</a> based on this <a href="http://www.smartjava.org/examples/population/">population map</a>.</p>
		<h4>Why not support more countries?</h4>
		<p>
			This is a two part answer. First, it takes time for me to support these zip codes, and they have to be routinely updated. This list of countries is a good
			test bed. However, if this tool becomes more popular I may start to add to the database.  If you absolutely need more countries right away, you can
			download the source code and add your CSV files to run on your own servers.  It's really that easy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, it's hard to find good data. Many of the zip code files I've found are missing information, or are incomplete in some way. There are some countries where I 
			Can't find files at all.
		</p>
		<h4>Where can I get the source?</h4>
		<p>
			The source is available on <a href="https://github.com/rchargel/zilch">GitHub</a>. You'll need <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> to
			run or install this on your own server.
